/*
How can we implement stack and queue using the containers that we have?
Stack:
	just limit the functionality of a vector/deque to only allow push_back and pop_back

Queue:
	just limit the functionality of a deque to only allow push_back and pop_front
plus only allow access to top element

For this reasion, stacks and queues are known as container adaptors.
